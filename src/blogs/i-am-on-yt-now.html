I'm trying to get out of my bash ("shell", pun intended) to try and contact with so called fellow humans so I started my YT channel from some days ago and i started to upload stuff related to (you know) computers and it's in Arabic so do not bother checking it (or do: youtube.com/channel/UC5-6sB2VEojPNvttTnvCOVw) and i'm planning to be like 'the hated one' or 'techlore' but in Arabic of course so wish me luck on my new journey.</p></div>
