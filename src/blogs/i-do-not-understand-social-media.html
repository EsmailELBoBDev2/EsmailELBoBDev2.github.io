    <p>Well, i think i do not understand social media. why i say that, because i really do not get it. Facebook for
      example they block you from friending people you do not know in real life which is kind of okay i get it but what
      about people i knew? people i know i literally meet almost on daily basis, in school or in workplace so why the
      hell do i need social media for? i literally do not need it. if i want to say something for my 'classmate' i just
      wait till next day and i say it in the face, if i want a file or something i share it via bluetooth so only reason
      that makes me use social media is for knowing new people (people i do not know already) but facebook do not allow
      me to! so literally i do not see anything useful from social media except it's toxic for teens* and really i do
      not see anything, really anything that can comes from social media and that is why my friend i decided to delete
      my last social media accounts (instagram) for good...FUCK YOU FACEBOOK, FEEL FREE TO SUCK MY -<b><i>so fucking
