          Diaries</i></b>" on spotify (<i>yes spotify</i>) and i was playing "<b>The Pirate Bay</b>" and i enojyed it.
      In fact i enjoyed it to where i wanted to write this blog and tell you that i -<i>fucking</i>- love piracy and i
      will tell you about my <i>secret</i> sources to get stuff. So before i start, I want to say that love piracy and
      i'm going to share my sources and i don't give a fuck if someone is mad. So my sources are or better to say one
      source is mainly comming from: <b><a
          href="https://reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/megathread">https://reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/megathread</a></b> or <a
        href="https://libredd.it/r/piracy/wiki/megathread">https://libredd.it/r/piracy/wiki/megathread</a> <i>(if you
