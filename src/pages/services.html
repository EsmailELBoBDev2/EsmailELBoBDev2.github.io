    <p>Hi, This is my first attempt to host my own version of famous FOSS applications. I know it's not much and i'm aware it's not on my own 'VPS' or 'home server' but that's because hosting this many on a VPS will cost me really a lot (40 EUR which translates into ~725 EGP each month) so i had the idea of hosting some on my pretty cheap VPS (just 75 EGP per month) until maybe i get more money or even get donations from you guys! and then i will translate these services one by one into my own VPS (or even get a home server!) so for now please enjoy my free hosted heroku FOSS applications until i pay for VPS and maybe start with invidious. It's random links now i'm aware (until i pay for domain name too :p) which will be soon i hope 2-3 days -- It's limited to 5 due heroku's limitations but i plan on getting verified soon too and i did not change a single setting in all applications so all are vanilla instances</p>
